    "### 3 Practical Applications of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP):\n",
    "1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): In various NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, and language generation, CSPs can be used to enforce linguistic constraints. For example, in syntactic parsing, CSPs can help in constructing parse trees that adhere to grammar rules and word dependencies. In semantic analysis, CSPs can assist in resolving ambiguities and inconsistencies in language understanding by enforcing constraints based on semantic rules and contextual information. This allows for the return of results, such as in ChatGPT, that make actual sense because they follow the convention of our semantics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource Allocation: CSPs can be employed to model these allocation problems and find solutions that maximize resource utilization while ensuring timely results, staff satisfaction, and operational efficiency. One example is healthcare, where resource allocation is seen in tasks such as assigning hospital beds, scheduling surgeries, or allocating medical staff. These involve dealing with multiple constraints like resource availability, patient urgency, and medical staff preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Timetabling and Course Scheduling: Educational institutions face challenges in creating timetables and schedules for classes, exams, and other academic activities that satisfy various constraints like room availability, faculty preferences, course prerequisites, and student preferences. CSPs can be applied to generate optimal timetables that minimize conflicts and maximize resource utilization while meeting all constraints. This can lead to more efficient use of resources and improved academic outcomes for students.\n"

    "## Why is Sudoku a Constraint Satisfaction Problem?\n",
    "Sudoku has two sets of main rules. All boxes in a 3x3 grid must have one instance of each number 1-9. All rows and columns must contain the numbers 1-9. Following these two rules, one can attempt to solve for the goal state, where the entire grid is filled and the above rules are satisfied. There is only one unique goal state. There are a set number of total scenarios that are possible, making it a discrete environment. The sudoku also does not change, making its environment static. The sudoka is entirely observable, meaning no information is withdrawn besides what we are solving for, and since the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the actions of the agent (the solver), then the environment is also deterministic. **By setting these rules and transcribing it into code, we can approach solving sudokus as a constraint satisfaction problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules allow for when one state gets updated, you can get to the solution by getting to state to state. There are two main rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If a square has only one possible value, then eliminate that value from the square's peers (rows, cols, squares)\n",
    "(2) If a unit has only one possible place for a value, then put the value there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of strategy (1) if we assign 7 to A1 (the top left spot), we see that A1 has only one value, and thus the 7 can be removed from its peer A2 (and all other peers). As a separate example of strategy (2), if it turns out that none of A2 through A9 has a 3 as a possible value, then the 3 must belong in A1. This process is called constraint propagation, because we use set constraints to move through different states with the arrival of more and more information building on each other. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, that whenever we make a decision for the possible states, we eliminate a ton of possibilities. In square H7 of our grid2, we have two possibilities, 6 and 9. We can try 9 and quickly see that there is a contradiction. That means we've eliminated not just one possibility, but fully half of the possible choices that had included 9 in spot H7. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, how we search through these possible scenarios. First make sure we haven't already found a solution or a contradiction using the code we already have. If we do not, we choose one unfilled square and consider all its possible values. One at a time, we try assigning the square's possible values and searching from the resulting position. In other words, we search for a value $d$ such that we can successfully search for a solution from the result of assigning $d$ to that square. If the search leads to an failed position, go back and consider another value of $d$. This is a **depth-first search** because we are recursively considering all possibilities for assigning $d$ to a square before we consider a different value of $d$ for that square.\n",
    "\n",
