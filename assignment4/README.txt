CHANGE FOR ASSIGNMENT 4

To run this submission, you will need to ensure the following:

IMPORTANT to ensure you have tensorflow installed with tensorflowhub. 

You also have to have the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file in the same folder as the one 'Assignment1.ipynb' is located in. 

For the .ipynb file, run each cell from top to bottom.

I am using a python 3.9.13 kernel with our packages downloaded. 

Besides utilizing the TA and the materials we were given in lectures, I also used documentation on CelebA Progressive GAN to complete this assignment:  https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf_hub_generative_image_module

I also used stackoverflow to answer a few questions regarding how to properly utilize tensorflow and other appropriate packages for displaying results and taking in input. 

As noted in the final part of assignment, there were more analysis that I wanted to do to run the model for images outside of the CelebA dataset.
