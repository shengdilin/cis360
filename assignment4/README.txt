To run this submission, you will need to ensure the following:

DOWNLOAD THE KAGGLE DATASET FROM https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/sudoku?resource=download IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS OUR IPYNB FILE

For the .ipynb file, run each cell from top to bottom.

I am using a python 3.9.13 kernel with our packages downloaded. 

Besides utilizing the materials we were given in lectures, I also used documentation for a similar solver for inspiration: https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Sudoku.ipynb

I also used stackoverflow to answer a few questions regarding how to properly utilize and conduct backtracking for our sudoku problem. 

It was cool to see how fast and accurately the computer could solve this mind puzzles that take me much longer personally haha.
