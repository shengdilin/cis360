To run this submission, you will need to follow the given steps:

IMPORTANT to download RetinaFace using "pip install retina_face" before trying to exectue the code.

The additional image dataset and other images I use are included as additional files attached to this submission in a zip folder, "Dataset.zip"

You have to unzip Dataset.zip in the same folder that you have the .ipynb file in. 

You also have to have the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file in the same folder as the one 'Assignment1.ipynb' is located in. 

For the .ipynb file, run each cell from top to bottom.

I am using a python 3.9.13 kernel with opencv, matplotlib, numpy AND RETINAFACE downloaded. 

Besides utilizing the TA and the materials we were given in lectures, I also used documentation on RetinaFace to complete this assignment:  https://github.com/serengil/retinaface
