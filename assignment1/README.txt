To run this submission, you will need to follow the given steps:

First you need to have loaded the 'sportsteam.png' file given to us by Professor Chapla. 

The additional images I use, 'img1.png' and 'img2.png', are included as additional files attached to this submission.

These three images have to be in the same folder as the one 'Assignment1.ipynb' is located in. 

You also have to have the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file in the same folder as the one 'Assignment1.ipynb' is located in. 

For the .ipynb file, run each cell from top to bottom and use the q key to navigate through the pop-up windows and see how the classifier categorizes faces. 

I am using a python 3.9.13 kernel with opencv, matplotlib, and numpy packages downloaded. 

Besides utilizing the TA and the materials we were given in lectures, I did not utilize other resources.
