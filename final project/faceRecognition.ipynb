If this number is high, say 4, it skips multiple levels of image \"zooms\", increasing speed with less calculations but also potentially decreasing accuracy as faces of a certain size may no longer be detected by an algorithm that runs a smaller imageScale. minNeighbors directly correlates to the quality of the face, the \"sureness\" of the algorithm. When set too low, the algorithm may detect faces that are not actually there. Increasing this number raises the amount of conditions the \"face\" that the classifier is considering has to fulfill to be returned as a face. So by increasing this number, you add more \"sureness\" to the algorithm for it to return that it is a face."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"610e7561","metadata":{"id":"610e7561"},"source":["Now, we need to ensure that the file is saved appropriately with the bounding boxes.
